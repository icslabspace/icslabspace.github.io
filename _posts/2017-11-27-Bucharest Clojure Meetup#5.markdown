       <p>2017's last meetup was a mixture of leaning some things about semantics, Clojure and .. planes. Of course that we are speaking about paper gliders knowledge gathered as folding experience.</p>

#### Speaker

<p><a href="https://github.com/alex-gherega">avr.PhD. Alex Gherega</a> is a Clojure enthusiast and a true didact, always curious to learn new and interesting things.</p> 

#### Topic

<div class="ui container">
    <p>In the first part of the presentation, Alex discussed semantic approaches and some of their applications. Then we joined him in a live coding example in the quest of finding what "ISIR" is. Clojure.spec library proved to be very helpful when deadling with semantics in a dynamic language. </p>

    <br/>
    <p>Since each participant has his own answer for the question "What is a plane?", Alex proved once again that understanding semantics is one of the fundamental pillars for building a truly intelligent algorithm. </p>

    <p>At the end of his presentation, Alex challenged the audience to discussed the future of this community and some ideas regarding some joint projects under the Clojure umbrella.</p>
    
    <p>The last but not least achievement of the evening was learning how to fold a paper plane. We all enjoyed it very much! </p>
