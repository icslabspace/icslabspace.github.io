        <p>July's session gathered both passionate Clojure engineers that have been using this language for years but also curious people that work on research topics in medicine and legal domains. They all see Clojure as a potential ally for the computer scientific part of their work.</p>

#### Topics 

<div class="ui container">
  <p>The first <a href="/meetup/ClojureScript%20in%20action.pdf">talk</a> was focused on ClojureScript. We looked into why choose it over JavaScript, which are its main benefits, how to setup a friendly working environment and which are the most common tools. In the end, we created a new leiningen based ClojureScript project, added some HTML tags, changed the CSS and tested some functions and macros from the REPL. </p>
  
  <p>The second talk of the evening was about <a href="https://github.com/yetibot">Yetibot</a>, a feature-rich chatops tool written in Clojure. Victor showed us the benefits of using Yetibot as a part of a big development team at <a href="https://code4.ro/">Code 4 Romania</a>, an organization where he has been volunteering for more than 1 year.</p>
  
  <p>During his <a href="https://github.com/cvic/awesome-chatops-with-yetibot-slides/blob/master/index.html">presentation</a> Victor tested Yetibot's integration with Slack through several queries. In the end, we also had a peek at the Clojure code behind it. </p>
