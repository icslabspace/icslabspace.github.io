#### Speakers

<p><a href="https://github.com/cvic">Victor Cleja</a> is a regular Java EE dev that tries to use various Clojure tools in his day-to-day work without getting caught.</p> 

<p>Sonny is freelance software engineer from Philadelphia, PA but now he's a nomad and the last place he called home was NYC. Sonny has been programming with Clojure since 2010 and he liked it so much that he took a pay cut just so he can work on a clojure project 3 years ago.  Now he is just taking a break from working so he can work on tech problems that interests him.</p>

<p>The founder of <a href="http://www.icslab.eu">icslab.eu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alex-gherega">avr.PhD. Alex Gherega</a> is a Clojure enthusiast and a true didact who brings a new educational project to the table.</p>

#### Topics

<div class="ui container">
    <p>Victor showed us his way of exploring the Clojure ecosystem using Clojure. He looks for interesting clj repositories and their dependencies in order to get a better overview of the community and the inspiration for his future projects.</p>

    <br/>
    
    <p>Sonny told us a few things about his new project: a peer-to-peer distributed decentralized database and its potential real world applications. He writes Clojure code while interacting with Datomic and geo-position systems to bring his idea to life.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Alex challenged the audience to start contributing to the local community and to improve Clojure skills through a series of events and workshops conducted by the group's most experienced engineers and developers. Ideas and suggestions are welcome and a roadmap will be put together soon.</p>
